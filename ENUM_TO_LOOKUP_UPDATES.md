# Enum to Lookup Table Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated application code to use lookup table relationships instead of enum fields after database migrations converted enums to foreign key relationships.

## Models Updated

### 1. ProductInventory
- Updated `addStock()`, `removeStock()`, `reserveStock()`, and `releaseReservation()` methods to use `InventoryTransactionType` lookup
- Modified `recordTransaction()` method to accept `transactionTypeId` instead of `type` string
- Already had `productInventoryStatus()` relationship defined

### 2. InventoryTransaction
- Removed TYPE_ constants (TYPE_PRODUCTION, TYPE_PURCHASE, etc.)
- Already had `inventoryTransactionType()` relationship defined
- Methods `isInbound()` and `isOutbound()` already use the relationship

### 3. CropTask
- Updated fillable array to use `crop_task_type_id` and `crop_task_status_id`
- Added `cropTaskType()` and `cropTaskStatus()` relationships

### 4. TimeCard
- Updated fillable array to use `time_card_status_id`
- Added `timeCardStatus()` relationship
- Updated `scopeActive()`, `clockOut()`, and `checkMaxShiftExceeded()` methods to use the relationship

### 5. Invoice
- Already uses `paymentStatus()` relationship
- No changes needed

## Lookup Table Models Created

1. **InventoryTransactionType** - For inventory transaction types
2. **CropTaskType** - For crop task types
3. **CropTaskStatus** - For crop task statuses
4. **TimeCardStatus** - For time card statuses

Each lookup model includes:
- Standard fields: code, name, description, color, is_active, sort_order
- `findByCode()` static method for easy lookup
- `scopeActive()` and `scopeOrdered()` query scopes

## Filament Resources Updated

### 1. ProductInventoryResource
- Form: Changed status select to use `product_inventory_status_id` with relationship
- Table: Updated status badge column to use `productInventoryStatus.name`
- Filter: Updated status filter to use relationship
- Bulk action: Updated "Mark as Damaged" to use lookup table

### 2. ProductInventoryStats Widget
- Updated all queries using `status = 'active'` to use `product_inventory_status_id`

### 3. TimeCardResource
- Form: Changed status select to use `time_card_status_id` with relationship
- Table: Updated status column to use `timeCardStatus.name`
- Filter: Updated status filter to use relationship
- Actions: Updated clock_out and resolve_review actions to use lookup table

## Factories Updated

### CropTaskFactory
- Updated to use `crop_task_type_id` and `crop_task_status_id` from lookup tables
- Gets random task type from available types in database
- Uses pending status from lookup table

## Migration Created

### Add Missing Inventory Transaction Types
- Created migration to add missing transaction types: production, expiration, reservation, release
- These types were used in the code but missing from initial lookup table migration

## Key Changes Pattern

When updating from enum to lookup:
1. Replace enum field with foreign key field (e.g., `status` → `time_card_status_id`)
2. Add belongsTo relationship to model
3. Update any hardcoded enum comparisons to use relationship (e.g., `$model->status === 'active'` → `$model->timeCardStatus?->code === 'active'`)
4. Update Filament resources to use relationship selects and columns
5. Update factories to get IDs from lookup tables
6. Update any queries filtering by enum values

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run migrations to ensure all lookup tables are created and populated
2. Test each model's CRUD operations
3. Verify Filament resource forms and tables display correctly
4. Check that filters work with the new relationships
5. Ensure factories can create test data successfully
