# Physical Processes and timeline for microgreen crops


***overview***
- Harvest days are wednesdays
- Delivery days are thursdays
- Most crops are 9-12 days to maturity
- Some are longer 14-21 but those are grow to order
- 2 types of customers
	- retail farmers markets, direct to customers
	- wholesale grocery stores, farmers CSA boxes
- Stages of the crops
	- seed soak (only some crops)
	- planting
	- germination (3-8 days crop depending)
	- blackout (1-2 days select crops)
	- light (remaining days)
	- harvest
- Crops are grown following precise processes to ensure quality and no problems
- environment is controlled via Home Assistant
	- 71-73F temp
	- 45-50% relative humidity
	- fans to circulate air following
	- 16/8 light cycles (standard for all crops)
	- Environmental data logged in Home Assistant

Planting
- pre mix fertilizer into soil (standard ratio for all crops)
- make up trays with soil
- portion out seed for number of trays being planted
- sew the seed
- water it in based on recipe/procedure for that specific crop
- stack trays with standard weight procedure

Germination
- Trays are left to germinate for a crop specific procedure
- They are moved to blackout and or put under light when expected via the recipe
- Some recipes require liquid fertilizer application on specific days during watering schedule

Blackout
- cover trays with no holed tray flipped upside down
- stretches crop to make it easier to harvest

Light
- Trays are placed on chrome wire shelves under led lights for a 16/8 light cycles
- They are bottom watered daily before the morning light cycles on based on a watering schedule that comes from a crop recipe.
- Trays are rotated each morning to ensure balanced watering in case shelves are slightly out of level
- based on the recipe watering is suspended 24-48 hours before harvesting to allow the crop to dry out which ensures optimal product quality when packaging.

Harvesting
- Employee creates a list of all orders for the week
- Calculates how much of each crop they need to harvest
	- certain crops are combined to form mixes
		- recipes contain percentage requirements of each crop variety to complete the mixes
	- Makes a list with a detailed breakdown of what type and qty of packaging required 
- Harvest crops and store in large containers in walk in fridge
- As the crops are harvested, harvest weights are captured and logged
	- the harvest list that was created if checked off to ensure adequate harvesting of crops was completed
- Trays are emptied of soil and roots
- Trays are washed and sanitized
- Trays are dried and re-stacked so that they can be used for planting

Packaging
- employee creates a delivery list
	- details qty of each variety and in which packaging
	- labels are put on the packaging and harvest dates written on the labels
- Package the crops based on this list, place in fridge and ready for delivery.

Consumables Inventory Management
- Track inventory levels for:
  - Packaging materials
  - Labels
  - Other consumables
- Monitor reorder thresholds
- Generate reorder alerts when thresholds are reached

Packaging and Delivery
- Generate weekly order aggregation
- Calculate mix requirements based on recipes
- Create harvest checklist
- Create packing checklist
- Track packaging material usage
