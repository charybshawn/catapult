# Claude AI Assistant Guidelines for Catapult Project

## üö® CRITICAL: Avoid Code Sprawl at All Costs

**Code sprawl** is the #1 enemy of this codebase. It happens when AI assistants:
1. Try one approach and it fails
2. Immediately jump to a completely different approach 
3. Leave the failed code behind
4. Create multiple half-working solutions
5. Result: Spaghetti codebase with dead code everywhere

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SIGNS OF CODE SPRAWL:
- Creating multiple pages/resources/classes that do the same thing
- Leaving broken/unused files in the codebase
- Jumping between approaches without cleaning up
- Creating "temporary" solutions that become permanent
- Not finishing what you start before moving on

## üéØ The RIGHT Approach

### BEFORE starting any code:
1. **Read existing code first** - understand what already exists
2. **Look for existing solutions** - can you extend/fix what's there?
3. **Plan your approach** - don't code until you have a clear plan
4. **Commit to ONE approach** - see it through to completion
5. **Code changes require DB schema changes** - if a requested code change, absolutely requires a schema change at the DBMS level, then prompt the user to create a new git feature branch
6. **Require evidence of relevance** - when encountering variables, fields, or objects that don't have corresponding DB columns or seem unused, require DIRECT EVIDENCE that they are connected to the current codebase before making accommodations or schema changes. Example: finding a reference to `status` instead of `status_id` doesn't mean we create a `status` column - it means we fix the reference to use `status_id` since we've clearly moved from enums to lookup tables. Don't change the entire codebase architecture because of one dangling legacy reference!

### üîç How to Prevent Common Mistakes:

1. **Configuration Sprawl Prevention:**
   - ALWAYS check existing code for configuration patterns
   - Use existing constants and config files
   - Don't hardcode paths - use Laravel helpers like `base_path()`, `storage_path()`
   - When in doubt, grep for similar functionality first

2. **Path Consistency:**
   - Backup files: ONLY use `database/backups/`
   - Temp files: Use `storage/app/temp/`
   - Uploads: Use `storage/app/uploads/`
   - NEVER create new directories without checking CLAUDE.md first

3. **Before Creating ANY New File:**
   - Search for existing files with similar names
   - Check if the functionality already exists
   - Look for TODO comments that might indicate planned features
   - Ask yourself: "Am I creating a duplicate?"

### DURING coding:
1. **Fix, don't replace** - prefer editing existing code over creating new files
2. **Test as you go** - don't write 200 lines before testing
3. **If something fails** - debug and fix it, don't abandon it
4. **Clean up as you go** - remove dead code immediately

### AFTER coding:
1. **Delete any failed attempts** - don't leave broken code behind
2. **Consolidate duplicated functionality** - merge similar files
3. **Update documentation** - keep this file current


### üóÇÔ∏è STANDARDIZED BACKUP STORAGE LOCATION
**ALL backup files MUST be stored in: `database/backups/`**

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER USE THESE PATHS:**
- `storage/app/backups/` - DO NOT USE
- `storage/app/backups/database/` - DO NOT USE
- Any other location - DO NOT USE

**ALWAYS USE:** `base_path('database/backups/')` in PHP code

**Why this matters:** Multiple backup locations create confusion, duplicate files, and make it impossible to reliably find backups. We've already fixed this issue multiple times - don't reintroduce it!

## üßπ Code Cleanup Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] Are there any duplicate files doing the same thing?
- [ ] Are there any broken/unused files left behind?
- [ ] Does everything actually work end-to-end?
- [ ] Have you removed any "temporary" test code?
- [ ] Are there any console errors or warnings?
- [ ] Did you test the happy path AND error cases?

## üö´ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't create multiple solutions** - Pick one approach and make it work
2. **Don't leave broken code** - If you break something, fix it immediately
3. **Don't create "temporary" files** - They become permanent technical debt
4. **Don't ignore errors** - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
5. **Don't create new files if you can extend existing ones**
6. **Don't use emojis/emoticons in code or output** - Keep code clean and professional
7. **Don't use `\Log::` - ALWAYS use `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;` and then `Log::`** - This error happens constantly

## ‚úÖ What TO Do

1. **Read before you write** - Understand the existing codebase
2. **Fix before you replace** - Try to repair existing functionality first
3. **Test early and often** - Don't write 100+ lines without testing
4. **Clean up immediately** - Remove any failed attempts right away
5. **Document your changes** - Update this file when you modify the system
6. **Ask Questions** - Whenever you need to prompt the user for clarification

## üèóÔ∏è Filament Resource Architecture

**MANDATORY READING:** `docs/FILAMENT_RESOURCE_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`

### üéØ Core Rule: Work WITH Filament, Not Against It

When working with Filament resources, forms, tables, or pages:

1. **NEVER create custom observers, services, or blade templates** - Use Filament's built-in patterns
2. **ALWAYS extend Filament classes** - Don't create parallel systems
3. **ORGANIZE Filament components** - Don't reinvent them
4. **DELEGATE to specialized classes** - Keep main resource files under 150 lines

### üìÅ Required File Structure for Resources:
```
app/Filament/Resources/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XxxResource.php                    # Main coordinator (MAX 150 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XxxResource/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Forms/XxxForm.php             # Returns Filament form schema
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tables/XxxTable.php           # Returns Filament table components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Actions/XxxAction.php         # Custom actions with minimal logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pages/                        # Extend Filament page classes
```

### üé® HTML and Display Separation:
**ALWAYS use Blade views for complex HTML output:**

1. **Actions should delegate to views** - Don't build HTML strings in action classes
2. **Create dedicated view files** - Store in `resources/views/filament/actions/` or similar
3. **Pass data to views** - Let Blade handle the presentation logic
4. **Keep actions lightweight** - Actions should orchestrate, not generate HTML

**Example Pattern:**
```php
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Action delegates to view
return Action::make('debug')
    ->action(function ($record) {
        $html = view('filament.actions.crop-batch-debug', [
            'record' => $record,
            'firstCrop' => Crop::where('crop_batch_id', $record->id)->first(),
        ])->render();
        
        Notification::make()->body($html)->send();
    });

// ‚ùå BAD: HTML built in action
return Action::make('debug')
    ->action(function ($record) {
        $html = '<div class="mb-4">';
        $html .= '<h3>' . $title . '</h3>';
        // ... more HTML building
    });
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architectural Violations:
- Creating Laravel observers for Filament-managed operations
- Building custom services that duplicate Filament functionality
- Creating custom blade templates for forms/tables (use Filament components)
- Business logic in UI components
- **Building HTML strings in PHP classes** - Use Blade views instead
- Main resource files over 150 lines

**If you're unsure about Filament architecture, READ THE GUIDE FIRST.**

## üîÑ Future Development Guidelines

1. **Follow the Filament Resource Architecture Guide** - ALL new resources must use this pattern
2. **Extend functionality, don't replace it**
3. **Test with real data and real workflows**
4. **Keep the UI simple and intuitive**
5. **Document any new features in this file**
6. **Prefer code based solutions to altering database schema**
7. **Don't change the names of existing database schema columns**
