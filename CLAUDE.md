# Claude AI Assistant Guidelines for Catapult Project

## üö® CRITICAL: Avoid Code Sprawl at All Costs

**Code sprawl** is the #1 enemy of this codebase. It happens when AI assistants:
1. Try one approach and it fails
2. Immediately jump to a completely different approach 
3. Leave the failed code behind
4. Create multiple half-working solutions
5. Result: Spaghetti codebase with dead code everywhere

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SIGNS OF CODE SPRAWL:
- Creating multiple pages/resources/classes that do the same thing
- Leaving broken/unused files in the codebase
- Jumping between approaches without cleaning up
- Creating "temporary" solutions that become permanent
- Not finishing what you start before moving on

## üéØ The RIGHT Approach

### BEFORE starting any code:
1. **Read existing code first** - understand what already exists
2. **Look for existing solutions** - can you extend/fix what's there?
3. **Plan your approach** - don't code until you have a clear plan
4. **Commit to ONE approach** - see it through to completion
5. **Code changes require DB schema changes** - if a requested code change, absolutely requires a schema change at the DBMS level, then prompt the user to create a new git feature branch

### DURING coding:
1. **Fix, don't replace** - prefer editing existing code over creating new files
2. **Test as you go** - don't write 200 lines before testing
3. **If something fails** - debug and fix it, don't abandon it
4. **Clean up as you go** - remove dead code immediately

### AFTER coding:
1. **Delete any failed attempts** - don't leave broken code behind
2. **Consolidate duplicated functionality** - merge similar files
3. **Update documentation** - keep this file current


### üóÇÔ∏è STANDARDIZED BACKUP STORAGE LOCATION
**ALL backup files MUST be stored in: `database/backups/`**

## üßπ Code Cleanup Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] Are there any duplicate files doing the same thing?
- [ ] Are there any broken/unused files left behind?
- [ ] Does everything actually work end-to-end?
- [ ] Have you removed any "temporary" test code?
- [ ] Are there any console errors or warnings?
- [ ] Did you test the happy path AND error cases?

## üö´ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't create multiple solutions** - Pick one approach and make it work
2. **Don't leave broken code** - If you break something, fix it immediately
3. **Don't create "temporary" files** - They become permanent technical debt
4. **Don't ignore errors** - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
5. **Don't create new files if you can extend existing ones**
6. **Don't use emojis/emoticons in code or output** - Keep code clean and professional
7. **Don't use `\Log::` - ALWAYS use `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;` and then `Log::`** - This error happens constantly

## ‚úÖ What TO Do

1. **Read before you write** - Understand the existing codebase
2. **Fix before you replace** - Try to repair existing functionality first
3. **Test early and often** - Don't write 100+ lines without testing
4. **Clean up immediately** - Remove any failed attempts right away
5. **Document your changes** - Update this file when you modify the system
6. **Ask Questions** - Whenever you need to prompt the user for clarification

## üîÑ Future Development Guidelines

2. **Extend functionality, don't replace it**
3. **Test with real data and real workflows**
4. **Keep the UI simple and intuitive**
5. **Document any new features in this file**
6. **Prefer code based solutions to altering database schema**
7. **Don't change the names of existing database schema columns**

**Remember: The best code is no code. The second best code is code that already exists and works.**
