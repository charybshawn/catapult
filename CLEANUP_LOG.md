# Cleanup Log

## Migration Duplicate Files Cleanup - 2025-06-25

### Issue
Migration commands were failing due to duplicate migration files with " 2" suffix, causing Laravel to attempt creating the same tables multiple times.

### Resolution
- Removed all duplicate migration files with " 2" suffix from database/migrations/
- Removed all other duplicate files and directories with " 2" suffix throughout the project
- Migration system now functions properly without table creation conflicts

### Files Cleaned
- All migration files ending with " 2.php"
- Duplicate PHP files across app/, database/, bootstrap/, config/, resources/ directories
- Duplicate directories and markdown files

This cleanup ensures the migration system works correctly and prevents future conflicts.
