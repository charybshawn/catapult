/**
 * Filament resource for agricultural crop planning and production scheduling
 * with automated order-driven planning and harvest timeline management.
 *
 * This resource manages the sophisticated crop planning workflow that bridges
 * customer orders with actual agricultural production. It handles automatic
 * plan generation from orders, timeline calculations based on variety growing
 * periods, and approval workflows for production coordination.
 *
 * @filament_resource Manages CropPlan entities with agricultural production scheduling
 * @business_domain Agricultural production planning and crop timing coordination
 * @related_models CropPlan, Order, Recipe, CropPlanStatus, MasterSeedCatalog
 * @workflow_support Order-driven production planning and harvest scheduling
 * 
 * @agricultural_concepts
 * - Crop planning: Automated calculation of planting dates from delivery requirements
 * - Timeline management: Plant-by dates, expected harvest, delivery coordination
 * - Recipe integration: Growing instructions and variety-specific cultivation data
 * - Production scheduling: Tray requirements, seed quantities, space planning
 * 
 * @planning_automation
 * - Order analysis: Extracts variety requirements and delivery dates from orders
 * - Timeline calculations: Works backward from delivery to determine planting schedules
 * - Resource planning: Calculates tray counts and seed requirements automatically
 * - Buffer management: Includes safety margins for agricultural production variability
 * 
 * @workflow_features
 * - Draft â†’ Approved workflow with agricultural validation
 * - Missing recipe detection and creation workflow integration
 * - Bulk approval operations for production scheduling efficiency
 * - Real-time urgency indicators for planting deadlines
 * - Calendar integration for visual production planning
 * 
 * @business_intelligence
 * - Days until planting with color-coded urgency indicators
 * - Resource summaries (total trays, total grams) for production capacity planning
 * - Missing recipe identification for cultivation workflow completion
 * - Grouping by variety and dates for production scheduling optimization
 * 
 * @agricultural_validation
 * - Planting timeline validation against variety growing periods
 * - Resource availability checking for production capacity management
 * - Recipe requirement validation for cultivation instruction completeness
 * - Order fulfillment validation to ensure delivery commitments are met
 * 
 * @performance_considerations
 * - Calendar-first interface optimized for visual production scheduling
 * - Session-persistent filters for production workflow efficiency
 * - Eager loading of complex relationships prevents N+1 queries
 * - Automated plan generation with bulk processing for efficiency
