# Seed Entry Removal Audit Report

## Date: July 8, 2025

## Summary
This document tracks the removal of deprecated `seed_entry_id` and `supplier_soil_id` fields from the Recipe model and related code throughout the codebase.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Database Migrations
- ✅ Created migration `2025_07_08_083834_remove_seed_entry_id_from_recipes_table.php`
- ✅ Created migration `2025_07_08_084053_remove_supplier_soil_id_from_recipes_table.php`
- ✅ Both migrations have been run successfully

### 2. Model Updates

#### Recipe Model (`app/Models/Recipe.php`)
- ✅ Removed `seed_entry_id` from fillable array
- ✅ Removed `supplier_soil_id` from fillable array
- ✅ Removed `seedEntry()` relationship method
- ✅ Removed `soilSupplier()` relationship method
- ✅ Updated `getLoggedRelationships()` to remove 'seedEntry'
- ✅ Updated `getRelationshipAttributesToLog()` to remove 'seedEntry'
- ✅ Updated `getActivitylogOptions()` to remove both fields and add common_name/cultivar_name

#### Crop Model (`app/Models/Crop.php`)
- ✅ Removed `seedEntry()` method
- ✅ Updated `getVarietyNameAttribute()` to use recipe's cultivar_name directly

### 3. Service Updates

#### HarvestYieldCalculator (`app/Services/HarvestYieldCalculator.php`)
- ✅ Updated `getRelevantHarvests()` to match by recipe's common_name and cultivar_name instead of seed_entry_id

### 4. Filament Resource Updates

#### CropPlanResource (`app/Filament/Resources/CropPlanResource.php`)
- ✅ Fixed eager loading issue - removed 'recipe.seedEntry' from modifyQueryUsing

### 5. Factory Updates

#### RecipeFactory (`database/factories/RecipeFactory.php`)
- ✅ Removed SeedEntry import
- ✅ Updated definition() to use common_name and cultivar_name
- ✅ Removed seed_entry_id assignment
- ✅ Added lot_number, expected_yield_grams, and buffer_percentage
- ✅ Removed forSeedVariety() method

## Files Still Requiring Updates

### 2. Database Seeders
- [ ] `database/seeders/Data/RecipesTableSeeder.php` - Remove seed_entry_id and supplier_soil_id assignments

### 3. Tests
- [ ] `tests/Feature/RecipeManagementTest.php` - Remove SeedEntry references
- [ ] `tests/Feature/RecipeTraceabilityTest.php` - Update tests
- [ ] `tests/Feature/RecipeFormValidationTest.php` - Update form validation tests

- [ ] `app/Console/Commands/CleanDuplicateSeedEntries.php` - Consider removal
- [ ] `app/Console/Commands/ClearSeedTestData.php` - Consider removal

### 5. Other Services
- [ ] `app/Services/SeedScrapeImporter.php` - Review for SeedEntry references
- [ ] `app/Services/OrderToCropService.php` - Check for seed_entry references

### 6. Views/Documentation
- [ ] `resources/views/filament/widgets/seed-entry-overview.blade.php` - Consider removal
- [ ] `docs/seed-inventory-system.md` - Update documentation

## Migration Path

The system has migrated from:
- **Old**: Recipe → SeedEntry → MasterSeedCatalog
- **New**: Recipe directly stores common_name and cultivar_name

This simplifies the data model and removes unnecessary indirection.

## Notes

1. The `SeedEntry` model and related tables may need to be removed in a future migration if they are no longer used elsewhere in the system.

2. Any code that previously accessed variety information through `recipe->seedEntry->common_name` should now use `recipe->common_name` directly.

3. The system now uses `lot_number` for inventory tracking instead of seed_entry references.

## Verification Steps

After all updates are complete:
1. Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
2. Check that recipe creation/editing still works in Filament
3. Verify that crop planning still functions correctly
4. Ensure harvest yield calculations work properly
