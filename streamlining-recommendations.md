**After**: 5 focused navigation groups

```
🏠 Dashboard & Overview (2 items)
  - Main Dashboard (consolidated)
  - Weekly Planning
  - Analytics (moved from separate group)

🌱 Production (4 items)
  - Crops
  - Recipes  
  - Crop Alerts (consolidated task management)
  - Tasks

📦 Products & Inventory (9 items)
  - Seeds (renamed from "Seed Entries", variations hidden)
  - Products (with integrated pricing)
  - Consumables
  - Categories
  - Suppliers
  - Packaging Types

⚙️ System (2 items)
  - Settings
  - Scheduled Tasks
```

#### 2. ✅ Eliminated Duplicate Resource Systems

**Removed/Hidden Resources:**
- ❌ `TaskScheduleResource` → Replaced by CropAlertResource
- 🔒 `SeedVariationResource` → Hidden (integrated into SeedEntryResource)
- 🔒 `PriceVariationResource` → Hidden (managed within ProductResource)
- ❌ `CropDashboard` → Removed (integrated into main Dashboard)
- 🔒 `ActivityResource` → Hidden (accessible via direct URL)
- 🔒 `ProductPhotoResource` → Already hidden (managed within ProductResource)

#### 3. ✅ Unified Management Systems

**Seed Management**: Single "Seeds" resource with integrated variations
- Eliminated 3-layer complexity: SeedEntry → SeedVariation → Consumable
- Variations managed as repeater fields within main seed form
- Clearer naming: "Seed Entries" → "Seeds"

**Pricing System**: Unified within ProductResource
- Removed standalone PriceVariationResource
- Price variations managed via relation manager
- Single source of truth for product pricing

**Task Management**: Consolidated into CropAlertResource
- Removed duplicate TaskScheduleResource
- Single interface for crop alerts and task management

### 🎯 Medium Priority Changes (ALL COMPLETED)

#### 4. ✅ Order Form Simplification (47% Reduction)
**Before**: 214 lines with complex conditional logic  
**After**: ~114 lines with essential fields only

**Removed Complexity:**
- ❌ Inline customer creation form (40+ lines eliminated)
- ❌ Complex reactive state management
- ❌ Conditional billing section visibility
- ✅ Simplified to essential customer selection + order details
- ✅ Made billing settings collapsible and collapsed by default

#### 5. ✅ Table Column Streamlining

**OrderResource Table:**
- Hidden non-essential columns by default (Template, Paid status)
- Consolidated customer type and billing frequency displays
- Reduced from 13+ columns to 8 visible by default

**ProductResource Table:**
- Hidden Mix and In Store columns by default
- Maintained essential information: Name, Image, Category, Active, Packaging
- Non-essential columns accessible via toggle

**General Improvements:**
- Many resources already had good column organization
- Added toggleable hidden states where appropriate
- Preserved detailed information access while reducing initial clutter

### 🧹 Low Priority Changes (COMPLETED)

#### 6. ✅ Hidden Underutilized Resources
- ActivityResource: Hidden from navigation (debug/admin use only)
- ProductPhotoResource: Already hidden, managed within ProductResource
- SeedVariationResource: Hidden, functionality integrated elsewhere
